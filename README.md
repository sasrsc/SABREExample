# SABREExample
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to show interested parties how a non dev team can migrate from the world of SABRE Scribe to a full blown SABRE Web App solution. To be 100% clear we are not pro dev. We are just experienced travel agents with a tech "leaning". The opportunities are endless with a true Web App solution and we decided in Dec 2020 to start work on an internal web app our own use. This is not for sale. This is even not approved by SABRE as a genuine Web App. In fact I expect we'll go through numerous submissions before they approve it for our own use. Just baby steps at every turn as this is a huge learning curve!
